# Debug Interface Components

A small collection of simple tools made to help debug a Godot game I'm working on. They are marked with `@tool` which means they will both update live in the editor.

## Debug Meter 2D
A simple customzable 2D control node for Godot that works as a meter. It takes a float input and represents it by the height of the meter (also shows the value below the meter).

Set up the meter with a max and min value, customize the colors and set the relative location of the baseline. The baseline is a way to identify a marker for a desired target value.

## Debug State Label 2D
This is a customzable label with a highlight state that can be toggled on and off.

I hope you find them useful.
